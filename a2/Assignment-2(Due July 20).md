# Assignment 2
(Due Thursday July 20 at 6:05pm in class)  
---

Create a cheat sheet for the midterm. You will __not__ be using this cheat sheet during the exam but writing it will help you prepare for it.

Submit one sheet of paper. You can use both sides if you wish but one is sufficient.  Your cheat sheet can contain anything that you feel would help you in the test. This might be definitions, summaries of concepts, example and explanations of code, etc.   

If you do not know what to put on your cheat sheet, some ideas might be

- summarize the lecture notes  
- answer the midterm practice problems  
- summarize every Java keyword we have seen so far


You will receive full marks if you put in a reasonable effort. Filling one page with a summary of course material will be considered a reasonable effort.

Your cheat sheet can be handwritten or computer generated. I strongly suggest to hand write it if you are able.

Note: Hand in your assignment at the start of class on Thursday. The test will start 1-2 minutes after the start of class, so be sure to arrive on time (or 5 minutes early).

Note: If you have another arrangement for writing the midterm with PMC, you should drop off the assignment at the main office of SCS (School of Computer Science) on the afternoon of the midterm some time before you write the test.
